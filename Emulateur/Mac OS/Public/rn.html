<p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b><font size="4">SE51 OS X Mercury</font></b><br /><font size="3">Release notes</font></font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><strong><br />Introduction</strong><br /><br />On <strong>Friday, May 18 2007,</strong> SE51 has launched the final code for the long anticipated personal homepage project named OS X Mercury, formerly code-named &quot;Asteroid&quot;. The Mercury website closesly resembles appearences and functionalities that come from Mac-maker Apple&#39;s operating system Mac OS X. The most notable feature in its premiering release is Time Machine - a 3D environment that allows the visitor to literally browse through older websites of SE51 and then open them in the built-in browser of the environment.<br /><br />The first version has been in the making for more than a year and consists of about 30,000 lines of code. Although based on platform independent technologies such as JavaScript and DHTML, Mercury has been developed entirely for Mozilla&#39;s Firefox browser. SE51 points out that Firefox is the most advanced platform independent browser available, therefore Firefox has been picked as the browser for which Mercury has been designed for. Most of the technologies presented, such as the Oxygen framework, is entirely based on Open Source technology, and is credited in the about box.<br /><br />OS X Mercury has recently been Beta tested by a small number of people, and has now been deemed stable for release. SE51 is now looking forward to the next version, and continuous bugfixing in the current release. Which features are planned for the next release have not been disclosed, however.<br /><br />The completion of the Mercury project completes the missing digital content that was planned to be found on SE51.net. With an ever growing content of digital content such as music and photos, Mercury provides an innovative approach of displaying this content online.</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">Legal information and disclaimer</font></strong></font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><br />SE51 is aware that many elements including trademark appearences such as a similar &quot;X&quot; logo, and a leopard fur in the background, or names such as Finder, Time Machine and Dashboard have been used and may lay the foundation for a lawsuit for violating Apple trademarks. I hereby declare to not to have the intention to break or violate any trademarks that belonog to Apple Inc. I admire the technology developed by Apple Inc., I also admire the way how the company appears in public. OS X Mercury has been created not only to display personal digital content, it was also developed as a display for technological skills for future job applications, but even more as an homage to Steve Jobs and his fellow developers who made one of the greatest operating systems ever hacked on keyboards. Again, me, the domain holder of se51.net does have any intention to break or violate any copyrights that are held and filed by Apple Inc. OS X Mercury has been created as a personal homepage with personal content.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>What&#39;s included in this version</strong><br /><br /><br />The following applications and technologies are included:<br /></font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><br /></font></p><ul>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Oxygen Framework<br />	</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Finder</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Time Machine</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Dashboard</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Safari</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Mail</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">iTunes</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">iChat</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">iWeb</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">iPhoto</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">System Preferences</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Moonlight real-time search</font></li></ul><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">For detailed information about the functionality of each tool, please visit <a href="http://www.se51.net/osx" target="_blank">http://www.se51.net/osx</a> </font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p><strong><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Known issues</font></strong></p><ul>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The dock may disappear when applications are opened.</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">I have been unable to repro this issue on the machines I have tested Mercury on, therefore I have not yet identified the root cause for this issue, but I am working on a fix for this.<br />	When a window is dragged over the area of the dock, the dock &quot;holder&quot; goes into the back, but the icons stay in front, and float above the window. The icon still zooms, but the text above it is also in the back like the dock &quot;holder&quot; image.</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Icons in Finder and Dock are not smooth on Windows machines. This is due to a lack of smoothing support on all Windows machines. It is uncertain if this can be fixed anytime soon. However, first versions of Firefox 3 show an improved smoothing support when it comes to scaling. If you are a bleeding edge tester, and you need to see smooth icons on Windows machines, you should try Mercury in the Alpha versions of Firefox 3. Also, SVG support for Mercury is pursued. Once implemented, all icons can be independently scaled. Icon smoothing is built in to Mac OS X. On those machines the dock will appear smooth from the beginning.</font></li>	<li><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The dock is slightly out of place directly after opening Mercury. This appears to be a bug in the rendering function of the dock script. Help on this would be appreciated. Fix for now: move the mouse over the dock once, then leave. This will bring the dock into the correct alignment.</font></li></ul><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p><strong><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Acquiring the source code</font></strong></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">SE51 is developing a Mercury exclusive &#39;application&#39; named &quot;MCode&quot;, which will be introduced to the environment at a later stage. This application allows potential visitors to look into the code that is running the environment. This includes the framework and all applications, as well as &#39;system services&#39; such as the Finder and Dock.</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p><p align="center"><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><font size="1">OS X Mercury<br />(c) 2007 SE51.net</font><br /></font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
